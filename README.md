This repository contains the code that implements a pixel-by-pixel editor for an RGB 32x32 LED display.
-> You can export the data as an Arduino byte array (please note this is meant to be inserted into a 3D array so will not compile as is)
-> You can import an existing Arduino byte array so that you can view and edit the corresponding bitmap
-> This code is FOSS with no warranties. The author is not responsible for misuse of this software.
